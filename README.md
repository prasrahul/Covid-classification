# Covid-classification
* The Covid Classifier can predict weather the patient is affected by Covid-19 or not affected by using the X-rays of the patient's chest 
* This model is trained with transfer learning of VGG16
* This project is deployed on Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* Link for the deployed project is https://covidclassifier-bright-ostrich-nx.cfapps.io/ (if the link is not working maybe the trail peroid is over for the application)
